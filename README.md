# Pong_Game
My version of the iconic Pong game from 1972. This was developed using the Unity Engine and C# scripts. Two players are required to play. Players can use a combination of 2 Gamepads, or 1 keyboard and 1 Gamepad to play. Keyboards, Xbox controllers, PS5/PS4 controllers have all been tested and are 100% compatible.
